# CapGrab
### Project Proposal

###### Description	
<p>CapGrab is a mobile application that allows users to receive caption ideas for photos or videos that they plan to post on social 
media. On the app, the user will be asked to create an account by providing a username, email, and password. The user can then upload 
photos and videos to their account for just their followers to see or to a main forum for all CapGrab users to see. The user can allow 
up to ten other users to follow them and have the ability to switch them whenever they want. Just because one user follows another does 
not mean that other user has to follow them back. These followers have the ability to view the userâ€™s photo and video posts and give 
caption ideas. The user and followers can then up vote the caption ideas. The amount of up votes a user gets builds their CapGrab score, 
which others can see.</p>
<p>Since research on this project began, similar applications have not been found. Some could compare this application to Instagram; 
however, there are key differences. CapGrab focuses more on the caption than the post itself.</p>
<p>This application requires cloud storage in order to store user photos and videos. Furthermore, a database will be needed to hold user 
information and paths to the photos and videos in storage. The project will use Swift to build the application to display the information 
to the user. Maintenance may be necessary for iOS updates, which could cause changes in Swift syntax.</p>

###### Justification
<p>This project allows our team to demonstrate the skills we have obtained through previous classes, past internships, and personal 
projects. In Interaction Design we learned effective methods to make applications user friendly, which will be important for retaining 
users and allowing them to learn how to use the app. Our Programming Languages class taught us multiple programming paradigms that Swift 
has, such as object-oriented and functional. Our Databases course taught us taught us how to efficiently store and query information, 
which is an integral part of CapGrab. Finally, our 401 class gave us experience building a project from the ground up. This will be 
beneficial in avoiding problems that we ran into last semester, which in turn will create a smoother project timeline.</p>
<p>Although we have a solid amount of experience and knowledge necessary for this project, the creation of CapGrab will definitely allow 
us to expand what we have previously learned. Each one our group members have varying levels of experience with different skills.Therefore, throughout the semester, we will constantly be learning from each other.  The combination of our individual knowledge and 
teamwork causes us to be confident that we will be able to finish the project by the end of the semester. We find that although confident 
with our project timeline, working on CapGrab will still provide difficult moments through the creation of the backend.</p>
